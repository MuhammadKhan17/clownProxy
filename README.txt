testing was done at home on my computers localhost and not the cpsc servers.
this proxy replaces all instances of "Happy" with "silly", this 
is case sensitive and it won't replace "happy". It also replaces 
all JPG images with that of 1 of 2 clowns that are randomly select, 
but their does seem to be some preference for clown 1, im not sure why. 
this program will not replace GIF or PNG as I was short on time and 
wasn't able to get those working. the assignmet doesn't ask to replace them 
so I think I am ok. 
the proxy only sends http 1.0 requests to the website but it can recieve 
infromation from http 1.1 from the browser/client.
